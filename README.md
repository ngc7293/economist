# economist

Download articles from The Economist's website and export them to a minimal HTML or Markdown file. Why? The Economist's website looks nice, but is extremely bloated. With this script, a 700k characters HTML page is reduced to a measly 7k.

TODO:

- Download images (it currently hotlinks)
- Download in-line pictures and graphs
- Support more output formats (maybe use a real template engine)
- Automatically download new articles
